## What is Curious Souls Caf√©?

Curious Souls Caf√© is a "third place" away from home and work, founded to counter the isolation of modern life. It's a global community that hosts events where people can explore life's big questions together. Our philosophy is centered on the power of face-to-face conversations to build deeper bonds in a safe, non-judgmental environment. This web app was originally created to support our in-person and online events.

## üìÇ For Contributors

The web app is <a href="https://github.com/curioussoulscafe/curious-souls-cafe" target="_blank">open source</a> and organized for easy contributions.

### File Organization
- `index.html` is the main page in the **root folder**.
- Topic pages (e.g., `icebreaker/index.html`) are in the **`/topics`** folder.
- Question sets (`.txt` files) are in the **`/questions`** folder.
- Images and other data are in the **`/images`** and **`/data`** folders, respectively.

### How to Add New Question Sets
1.  **Add Questions File**: Create a new `.txt` file in the `/questions` folder (e.g., `MyNewTopic.txt`). Add one question per line.

2.  **Create HTML Page**: Duplicate an existing topic folder (e.g., `icebreaker/index.html`) in the `/topics` folder and rename it (e.g., `mynewtopic/index.html`). Update the file's content to reference your new topic and `.txt` file.

3.  **Register the Deck**: In `index.html`, find the `TOPIC_CONFIGS` array and add a new object for your topic, specifying its `name`, `htmlFileName`, and `txtUrl`.

4.  **Update the Service Worker**: Add the file paths for your new `.txt` and `.html` files to the `FILES_TO_CACHE` array in `service-worker.js`. This ensures the new content can be cached.

### Managing Live Discussion Questions
The "Live Discussion" feature is controlled by the presence of a `live-discussion.txt` file in the `/questions` folder. Add the file to enable the feature for an event and remove it to disable it afterward. You will also need to uncomment/comment out the related elements in `index.html`.
