## âœ¨ What You Can Do with the Web App

* **Pick a Topic:** On the [main page](https://curioussoulscafe.github.io/curious-souls-cafe/), you'll see general questions like [Curious Talk](https://curioussoulscafe.github.io/curious-souls-cafe/curious-talk.html) and different topics like [Transitions](https://curioussoulscafe.github.io/curious-souls-cafe/transitions.html) or [Love Relationships](https://curioussoulscafe.github.io/curious-souls-cafe/love-relationships.html). Just click (or tap) on a topic button to dive in!

* **Get Random Questions:** Once you're on a topic page, tell the web app how many questions you'd like, and it will instantly give you new ones to ponder.

* **Find Specific Questions:** Looking for something particular? Use the search bar to find questions that match your keywords.

* **Save Questions:** See a question you like? Simply click or tap on it, and it will be added to your "Saved Questions" list at the bottom of the page. You can clear them anytime.

* **Optimized for On-the-Go:** The web app is designed to work seamlessly on smartphones and tablets, making it the ideal companion for dynamic, on-the-go interactions.

* **Join a Live Discussion**: During special events, a prominent "Live Discussion" button will appear on the main page, giving you access to real-time questions curated for that event.

## ðŸŽ² A Fun Little Secret!

Did you know there's a little Easter egg in the Curious Souls CafÃ© web app? The colors of the virtual question cards (when you highlight a question or a saved one by a click/tap) aren't just random! They're designed to subtly match the fun [dice](https://curioussoulscafe.substack.com/i/154389021/the-dice-decides) colors used by our event facilitators to make those in-person discussions even more engaging. It's a small nod to bring a bit of that real-world fun into your digital experience!

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Using the App

Here are some helpful tips to enhance your Curious Souls CafÃ© experience:

1. **Highlight Chosen Questions:** Always **highlight the question that is chosen** by tapping or clicking it. This makes it easier for other participants to focus on the active question, preventing confusion when multiple questions are displayed on the app at the same time.

2. **Return to Main Page:** Clicking the round **Curious Souls CafÃ© icon** at the top of any topic page will take you back to the main topic selection page. This has the same effect as clicking the "Leave Page" button at the bottom.

3. **Quick Scroll to Top:** The **"Top" button** located at the bottom-right corner of any topic page can be used to quickly scroll back to the top of the screen. This is especially useful if you've scrolled far down and need to quickly access controls or re-read the topic title.

4. **Single Random Question for Punishments:** For participants who land on a punishment (e.g., via specific [dice](https://curioussoulscafe.substack.com/i/154389021/the-dice-decides) colors used by our facilitators) which requires them to randomly choose a question and answer it:

   * Set the **"No. of questions to pick"** field to `1` (instead of the default value, e.g., `3`).

   * Then, have the participant tap **"Generate Questions!"** so that only one random question is displayed.

5. **Advanced Search & Clear:**

   * Searching with **nothing inputted in the search field** will display all questions in the current deck. Be mindful that this could quickly fill up the screen.

   * For more advanced searching, you can use your web browser's built-in "Find" functionality.

   * In case the screen becomes too crowded after a search, simply tap the **"Top" button** and then click the **"Search" button** again (or "Clear Search") to clear the search results and tidy up the display.

## ðŸ“š Introducing the Question Decks

Our in-person Curious Souls CafÃ© [meetup](https://curioussoulscafe.substack.com/p/event-structure) is your space for meaningful conversations and deep self-reflection. Like a cozy neighborhood cafÃ©, itâ€™s a place to share ideas, explore lifeâ€™s big questions, and connect with others in an open and welcoming way. At the heart of the Curious Souls CafÃ© experience are **questions**, thoughtfully designed by our facilitators or third parties to guide you through soul-searching discussions. Whether you're reflecting on your personal journey, navigating life changes, or building deeper connections, these decks spark introspection and encourage engaging dialogue.

Explore diverse themes like self-discovery, happiness, love, and authenticity, or revisit thought-provoking prompts inspired by our global community. These questions help uncover insights about who you are, where you've been, and where youâ€™re headed:

- **Curious Talk**: Probe deeper motivations and encourage introspective, insightful responses.
- **Transitions**: Navigate lifeâ€™s changes with prompts that foster reflection and personal growth.  
- **Happiness**: Explore your personal definition, experiences, and journey with happiness.
- **Love Relationships**: Deepen your connections and reflect on the dynamics of love and intimacy.  
- **Past Questions**: Engage with prompts shared by curious souls (participants) from around the world.  
- **Authenticity**: Align your actions with your values and embrace your true self.
- **The Mind Speaks**: Reflect on thoughts, feelings, and personal well-being.

ðŸ’– We express our heartfelt gratitude to the Singaporean facilitator(s) for the question sets for the topics [Love Relationships](https://curioussoulscafe.github.io/curious-souls-cafe/love-relationships.html), [Happiness](https://curioussoulscafe.github.io/curious-souls-cafe/happiness.html), and [The Mind Speaks](https://curioussoulscafe.github.io/curious-souls-cafe/the-mind-speaks.html), as well as to all curious souls (participants) who contributed [past questions](https://curioussoulscafe.github.io/curious-souls-cafe/past-questions.html) from our global events.

Let these decks inspire your journey of exploration, connection, and growth!

## ðŸ“‚ For the Tech-Savvy: How the Source Code is Structured

The Curious Souls CafÃ© web app keeps its questions organized in a simple way:

* The main page (`index.html`) is where you choose your topic.

* Each topic (like "Transitions" or "Love Relationships") has its own separate page (e.g., `transitions.html`).

* All the questions for each topic are stored in simple text files (`.txt`) inside the `questions/` folder. For example, all "Transitions" questions are in `questions/Transitions.txt`.

## ðŸ’ª For Event Facilitators

### How to Add New Question Sets

If you're an event facilitator looking to add new question sets to the main page, here's a straightforward process:

1.  **Add a new `questions.txt` file:** Create a new text file inside the `questions/` folder. Name it clearly, reflecting your new topic (e.g., `questions/MyNewTopic.txt`). Populate this file with your questions, one per line.

2.  **Duplicate an existing HTML subpage:** Choose an existing topic's HTML file (e.g., `transitions.html`) and duplicate it. Rename the duplicated file to match your new topic (e.g., `mynewtopic.html`).

Since the page title, `questions.txt` link, displayed topic name, and main page link are all handled dynamically and automatically, you don't need to manually update the new HTML file or `index.html`.

By following the these steps, you can seamlessly integrate new question sets into the Curious Souls CafÃ© web app for your events!

### Managing Live Discussion Questions

The "Live Discussion" feature or button is designed for dynamic, event-specific use. Its visibility is controlled directly by the presence of a specific file in the repository, eliminating the need for code changes in `index.html`.

This allows event facilitators to quickly activate and deactivate the live discussion feature as needed for their events.

To enable and disable the "Live Discussion" button for an event:

1. **To Enable the "Live Discussion" Button:**

   * **Place the `Live Discussion.txt` file** (containing the specific event's questions) inside the `questions` folder in the GitHub repository.

   * **Commit and push** these changes to the GitHub repository. (The changes should then be automatically deployed to GitHub Pages within a minute.)

   * The "Live Discussion" button will now be visible on the main page for participants. (Note: For those who already have the page loaded, they may need to refresh their mobile browser.)

2. **To Disable the "Live Discussion" Button (after the event):**

   * **Remove the `Live Discussion.txt` file** from the `questions` folder in the GitHub repository.

   * **Commit and push** these changes to the GitHub repository.

Thank you for visiting the Curious Souls CafÃ©! We hope it sparks many interesting conversations.
