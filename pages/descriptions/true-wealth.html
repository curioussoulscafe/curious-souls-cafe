    <p>A reflective exploration of what it means to be truly wealthy‚Äîto possess an abundance of what genuinely nourishes us.</p>
    <blockquote>
      "True wealth is the ability to fully experience life."
      <br>‚Äî Adapted from Henry David Thoreau
    </blockquote>
    <p>In a world that often equates wealth with financial capital, we are invited to discover a more profound and personal abundance. This gathering is for those curious to explore the currencies of time, attention, well-being, and connection that form the bedrock of a life well-lived.</p>
    <p>Come explore what it means to be rich in the ways that matter most. Share from the heart, and leave with a renewed sense of your own true wealth.</p>

    <h3>Inviting all who are...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>üåø Questioning the conventional definition of "a rich life"</li>
      <li>üí≠ Longing for more abundance in time, energy, or connection</li>
      <li>‚ú® Seeking to align their daily life with their deepest values</li>
      <li>üó∫Ô∏è Feeling the tension between making a living and designing a life</li>
      <li>üåÖ Interested in cultivating a sense of "enough" and sufficiency</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üìÖ Agenda / What You'll Experience</h2>

    <h3>üí¨ Icebreaker Conversation Cards (Round 1)</h3>
    <p>Begin with themed virtual questions cards to spark intimate and reflective exchanges. Below are sample questions:</p>
    <h4>1. Gentle Exploration:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>"What is one non-material thing that made you feel truly 'rich' recently?"</li>
      <li>"Describe a moment where you felt a deep sense of 'enough.'"</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>2. Personal Reflections:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>"What does your ‚Äòrich life‚Äô look like, feel like, and sound like? Describe it in vivid detail."</li>
      <li>"What is a ‚Äòwealth‚Äô you possess that you couldn‚Äôt put a price on? (e.g., a skill, a relationship, a perspective)"</li>
      <li>"Where do you currently experience the most scarcity in your life? (e.g., time, quiet, connection) And where do you experience the most abundance?"</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>3. Growth & Connection:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>"How can we cultivate ‚Äòwealth‚Äô in areas of scarcity?"</li>
      <li>"What is one small, daily ritual that makes you feel richer?"</li>
      <li>"How does the concept of ‚Äòtrue wealth‚Äô change how you think about your work and time?"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: This session may involve virtual question cards accessed via a link or QR code. If you do not have a device (phone/tablet) to access these, please ask a facilitator for assistance; we have spare units available.</p>

    <h3>üí¨ Spontaneous Reflective Question (Optional Round 2)</h3>
    <p>After warming up, our group will exchange ideas on an intriguing topic chosen spontaneously. We may continue with questions from Round 1 or write new ones. Each participant is encouraged to contribute by sharing a unique question or drawing inspiration from the conversation cards.</p>

    <h3>üí¨ Final Thoughts and Feedback</h3>
    <p>In the final 10 minutes, we‚Äôll reflect on the key insights, memorable moments, and takeaways from our discussions. This is a chance to distill shared wisdom and leave with a deeper understanding of the topic.</p>
    <p>After the event officially concludes, we may extend the session for informal conversations, depending on the group‚Äôs interest. You‚Äôre welcome to leave at any time that feels right for you.</p>
