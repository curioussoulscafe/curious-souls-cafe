    </p>

    <p>Join us for a transformative gathering to explore what it truly means to "grow up" in today’s complex and ever-changing world. Together, we’ll journey into the deeper dimensions of adulthood -- uncovering our authentic place within life’s intricate web and finding purpose rooted in belonging.</p>
    <blockquote>
      "Your soul is not something you have. It’s the unique place you occupy in the living world -- your gift to the whole."
      <br>-- Bill Plotkin
    </blockquote>
    <p>Whether expressed through nature, community, creativity, or service, this journey is about cultivating purpose rooted in belonging to the whole, moving beyond surface-level definitions of success.</p>

    <h2>Inviting All Who...</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🌿 Feel confined by narrow ideas of “adulthood.”</li>
      <li>🌀 Sense a deeper calling to contribute beyond productivity, or consumption.</li>
      <li>🌱 Long to translate your ideals into an embodied and meaningful purpose.</li>
      <li>⚡️ Seek the courage to live authentically amid life’s complexities.</li>
      <li>🍃 Wonder: What is my unique gift to the unfolding whole?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In a time of profound global change, we’re invited to reimagine adulthood -- not as a checklist of milestones, but as a lifelong journey of authentic belonging.</p>

    <h3>This collective experience is designed to help you:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>🔹 Reimagine adulthood as a journey of authentic belonging.</li>
      <li>🔹 Awaken to your soul’s purpose and unique gifts.</li>
      <li>🔹 Cultivate courage, integrity, and resilience for navigating life’s complexities.</li>
      <li>🔹 Embark on a path of transformative action for yourself and your community.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📅 Agenda / What You'll Experience</h2>

    <h3>💬 Icebreaker Reflective Cards</h3>
    <p>We’ll ground ourselves with specially crafted virtual reflective question cards, to connect with the universal dimensions of belonging. Sample reflective prompts include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Beyond Inherited Adulthood</strong><br>Reflect on the external constraints that no longer serve us:<br>
        <em>“What story about 'being a grown-up' did you inherit that now feels inauthentic?”<br>“Where have you felt parts of your deeper nature being suppressed?”</em>
      </li>
      <li><strong>2. Echoes of Belonging</strong><br>Reconnect with moments of deep connection to the greater whole:<br>
        <em>“When have you felt profoundly connected to something larger than yourself -- in nature, art, community, or service?”<br>“What experiences revealed your place in the greater web of life?”</em>
      </li>
      <li><strong>3. Soul as Compass</strong><br>Uncover the gifts your soul is ready to express to the world:<br>
        <em>“If your soul is your unique way of belonging to life, what gift wants to emerge now?”<br>“What early spark of curiosity points to your essential nature?”</em>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let’s discover together how to live from the deeper calls of our souls -- with purpose, courage, and a profound sense of belonging.</p>
    <p>Note: This session may involve virtual question cards accessed via a link or QR code. If you do not have a device (phone/tablet) to access these, please ask a facilitator for assistance; we have spare units available.</p>

    <h3>💬 Spontaneous Reflection Question (Optional Round)</h3>
    <p>After warming up, our diverse group of friends and strangers will come together in a circle to exchange ideas on an intriguing topic chosen spontaneously. We may either continue with questions from the round one, or write our own questions.</p>
    <p>From there, we’ll embark on a respectful, engaging, and meaningful conversation, celebrating the diversity of perspectives and ideas within the group.</p>

    <h3>💬 Final Thoughts and Feedback</h3>
    <p>Where time allows, in the final 10 minutes of the event, we’ll take a moment to reflect on the key insights, memorable moments, and takeaways from our discussions. This is a chance to distill the shared wisdom and leave with a deeper understanding of the topics we’ve explored together.</p>
    <p>After the event officially concludes, the group may choose to extend the session, depending on the group’s interest. Of course, you’re welcome to leave at any time that feels right for you.</p>
