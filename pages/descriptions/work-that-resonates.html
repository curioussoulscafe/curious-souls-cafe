    <p>A reflective gathering for those seeking alignment in their professional journey.</p>
    <blockquote>
      "Ikigai is where joy, skill, service, and sustenance converge. It‚Äôs work that feels less like a sacrifice and more like a quiet homecoming."
      <br>-- Inspired by H√©ctor Garc√≠a & The School of Life: On Work
    </blockquote>
    <p>Are you wondering:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>üåø How can my work align more deeply with who I am?</li>
      <li>‚öñÔ∏è Is it possible to honor both my values and my need for stability?</li>
      <li>‚ú® Where might purpose already exist, even in my daily tasks?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You‚Äôre not alone. This gathering is for anyone curious about weaving together purpose, skills, and livelihood--whether you see your work as a job, career, or calling.</p>

    <h3>Come explore with us:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>üîπ How to recognize "resonant work" (what energizes vs. drains you).</li>
      <li>üîπ Balancing idealism with realism, navigating the tension--without guilt.</li>
      <li>üîπ Small, brave steps toward meaningful professional progress.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üìÖ Agenda / What You'll Experience</h2>

    <h3>üí¨ Icebreaker Reflective Cards (Round 1)</h3>
    <p>Begin with themed virtual question cards weaving Ikigai‚Äôs wisdom and pragmatism. Here are some sample questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Passion and Strengths</strong><br>
        <em>What task makes time disappear for you? How could it play a larger role? When has work felt like play--or punishment?</em>
      </li>
      <li><strong>2. Impact and Sustenance</strong><br>
        <em>How does your current work serve others? How might it do so more deeply? Where do you negotiate between dreams and practicality?</em>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>From there, we‚Äôll embark on a respectful, engaging, and meaningful conversation, celebrating the diversity of perspectives and ideas within the group.</p>
    <p>Note: This session may involve virtual question cards accessed via a link or QR code. If you do not have a device (phone/tablet) to access these, please ask a facilitator for assistance; we have spare units available.</p>

    <h3>üí¨ Spontaneous Reflection Question (Optional)</h3>
    <p>After warming up, our diverse group of friends and strangers will come together in a circle to exchange ideas on an intriguing topic chosen spontaneously. We may either continue with questions from round one, or write our own questions.</p>
    <p>Each participant is encouraged to contribute by sharing a unique question. You‚Äôre welcome to bring a question that‚Äôs been on your mind, or you can draw inspiration from the conversation cards provided. Once all the questions are collected, the group will collaboratively select one to kick off the discussion.</p>
    <p>From there, we‚Äôll embark on a respectful, engaging, and meaningful conversation, celebrating the diversity of perspectives and ideas within the group.</p>

    <h3>üí¨ Final Thoughts and Feedback</h3>
    <p>Where time allows, in the final 10 minutes of the event, we‚Äôll take a moment to reflect on the key insights, memorable moments, and takeaways from our discussions. This is a chance to distill the shared wisdom and leave with a deeper understanding of the topics we‚Äôve explored together.</p>
    <p>After the event officially concludes, the group may choose to extend the session, depending on the group‚Äôs interest. Of course, you‚Äôre welcome to leave at any time that feels right for you.</p>
