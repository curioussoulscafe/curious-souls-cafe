    <p>Discover how your inner compass shapes your outer impact.</p>
    <p>If purpose is the inner compass that guides us, then legacy is the outer imprint we leave behind. This gathering is for those ready to explore how these two concepts dance together, informing and shaping each other to create a meaningful life.</p>
    <blockquote>
      "What we do for ourselves remains with us; what we do for others and the world becomes our legacy."
      <br>‚Äî Inspired by Kalu Ndukwe Kalu
    </blockquote>
    <p>We will explore legacy not as a final monument, but as the everyday echo of our values, connections, and actions. This is a space to reflect on the mark we make on our communities and our loved ones, however humble or vast that may feel.</p>
    <p>Come with curiosity, share from the heart, and leave with a broader perspective on how your journey shapes the world.</p>

    <h3>üëã Inviting all who are:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>üåø Exploring how what you leave behind informs who you are today</li>
      <li>üìú Thinking about the values and stories you wish to pass on</li>
      <li>üåç Sensing a desire to contribute to something larger than yourself</li>
      <li>üß≠ Ready to explore the outward impact of your inner compass</li>
      <li>üåü Ready to live in a way that aligns with the legacy you hope to leave</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üìÖ Agenda / What You'll Experience</h2>

    <h3>üí¨ Icebreaker Conversation Cards</h3>
    <p>Begin with themed questions to spark intimate and reflective exchanges about the footprints we leave behind. Here are some sample questions:</p>
    <h4>1. Influence and Impact:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>"Describe a time someone's simple kindness left a lasting 'imprint' on you. What did it teach you about the legacy of small acts?"</li>
      <li>"Who is one person (in your life or in history) whose legacy you feel you are building upon? What specifically are you carrying forward from them?"</li>
      <li>"What is one 'gift' you've received (a skill, a perspective, an opportunity) that you feel responsible for passing on to others?"</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>2. Deeper Reflection:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>"Beyond your job title or achievements, what is the one thing you hope people say about your character when you're not in the room?"</li>
      <li>"If your 'purpose' is your inner compass, what is one small, deliberate step you could take to let it guide your 'outer imprint'?"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: This session may involve virtual question cards accessed via a link or QR code. If you do not have a device (phone/tablet) to access these, please ask a facilitator for assistance; we have spare units available.</p>

    <h3>üí¨ Spontaneous Reflective Question (Optional Round)</h3>
    <p>After warming up, our group will exchange ideas on an intriguing topic chosen spontaneously. We may continue with questions from Round 1 or write new ones. Each participant is encouraged to contribute by sharing a unique question or drawing inspiration from the conversation cards.</p>

    <h3>üí¨ Final Thoughts and Feedback</h3>
    <p>In the final 10 minutes, we‚Äôll reflect on the key insights, memorable moments, and takeaways from our discussions. This is a chance to distill shared wisdom and leave with a deeper understanding of the topic.</p>
    <p>After the event officially concludes, we may extend the session for informal conversations, depending on the group‚Äôs interest. You‚Äôre welcome to leave at any time that feels right for you.</p>
