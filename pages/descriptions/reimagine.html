    <p>A reflective exploration of how we evolve our personal narratives, rediscover meaning, and grow into wiser versions of ourselves.</p>
    <blockquote>
      "Stories are compasses and architecture; we navigate by them, we build our worlds through them."
      <br>-- Adapted from Rebecca Solnit
    </blockquote>
    <p>As life unfolds in unexpected ways, old perspectives sometimes no longer fit who we’re becoming. This gathering is for those sensing a quiet call to reimagine -- to gently examine what stories, values, and ways of being still resonate, and which might need tender updating.</p>
    <p>Come with curiosity, share from the heart, and leave with fresh ways to envision your path forward.</p>

    <h3>Inviting all who are...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>🌿 Noticing subtle shifts in what feels true or meaningful.</li>
      <li>💭 Reflecting on how their perspectives have evolved over time.</li>
      <li>✨ Sensing new possibilities emerging from life’s changes.</li>
      <li>🗺️ Interested in how we navigate when familiar maps no longer fit.</li>
      <li>🌅 Appreciating both wisdom from the past and openness to renewal.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>🗓️ Agenda / What You'll Experience</h2>

    <h3>💬 Icebreaker Conversation Cards (Round 1)</h3>
    <p>Begin with themed virtual question cards to spark intimate exchanges. Here are some sample questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Personal Reflection</strong><br>
        <em>“What’s something you once believed wholeheartedly that you now see differently? What changed?”<br>
        “What wisdom from your past still guides you, and what might need reinterpreting?”<br>
        “How we honor our roots while making space for new understandings.”</em>
      </li>
      <li><strong>2. Growth & Evolution</strong><br>
        <em>“Where in your life are you sensing a quiet invitation to grow or see things anew?”<br>
        “The relationship between life experiences and evolving perspectives.”<br>
        “Ways to navigate uncertainty with both courage and self-compassion.”</em>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>From there, we’ll embark on a respectful, engaging, and meaningful conversation, celebrating the diversity of perspectives and ideas within the group.</p>
    <p>Note: The first round may involve virtual question cards accessed via a link or QR code. If you do not have a device (phone/tablet) to access these, please ask a facilitator for assistance; we have spare units available.</p>

    <h3>💬 Final Thoughts and Feedback</h3>
    <p>Where time allows, in the final 10 minutes of the event, we’ll take a moment to reflect on the key insights, memorable moments, and takeaways from our discussions. This is a chance to distill the shared wisdom and leave with a deeper understanding of the topics we’ve explored together.</p>
    <p>After the event officially concludes, the group may choose to extend the session, depending on the group’s interest. Of course, you’re welcome to leave at any time that feels right for you.</p>
