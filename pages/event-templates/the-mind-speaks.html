    <p>‚ù§Ô∏è A special thanks to our Singaporean facilitators for crafting the thought-provoking questions that shaped the success of this event at the Singapore branch of Curious Souls Caf√©.</p>
    <p>This event aims to raise awareness of mental health through sharing of perspectives and personal experiences using specially curated question cards on topics related to mental health and on a deeper level--the Mind.</p>
    <h3>Examples:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>How would you define good mental well-being?</li>
      <li>How can journaling or creative expression improve mental health?</li>
      <li>Do people have habitual thought patterns? If so, are they helpful and why?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Anyone is welcomed. You can choose to just listen or to share. At the end of the day, we hope everyone will leave with new insights and perspectives.</p>

    <h3>Inviting all Curious Souls who are passionate about:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>üåç Embracing open-mindedness.</li>
      <li>ü§ù Tapping into collective wisdom.</li>
      <li>üó£Ô∏è Engaging in meaningful conversations.</li>
      <li>üå± Embarking on a journey of self-improvement.</li>
      <li>üìö Exploring diverse schools of thought and personal experiences.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>üóìÔ∏è Agenda / What You'll Experience</h2>

    <h3>üí¨ Meaningful Icebreaker Conversation Cards (Round 1)</h3>
    <p>We will begin the session with the meaningful conversation cards. You'll have the opportunity to pick a card and initiate thought-provoking conversations with fellow attendees.</p>

    <h3>üí¨ Focused Discussion on a Meaningful Topic (Optional Round 2)</h3>
    <p>After warming up, our diverse group of friends and strangers will come together in a circle to exchange ideas on an intriguing topic chosen spontaneously.</p>
    <p>Each participant is encouraged to contribute by sharing a unique question. You‚Äôre welcome to bring a question that‚Äôs been on your mind, or you can draw inspiration from the icebreaker conversation cards provided. Once all the questions are collected, the group will collaboratively select one to kick off the discussion.</p>
    <p>From there, we‚Äôll embark on a respectful, engaging, and meaningful conversation, celebrating the diversity of perspectives and ideas within the group.</p>

    <h3>üí¨ Final Thoughts and Feedback</h3>
    <p>In the final 10 minutes of the event, we‚Äôll take a moment to reflect on the key insights, memorable moments, and takeaways from our discussions. This is a chance to distill the shared wisdom and leave with a deeper understanding of the topics we‚Äôve explored together.</p>
    <p>After the event officially concludes, we may choose to extend the session, depending on the group‚Äôs interest. Of course, you‚Äôre welcome to leave at any time that feels right for you.</p>
