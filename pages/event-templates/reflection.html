    <p>A reflective exploration of how we pause, process, and find clarity in life’s unfolding story.</p>
    <blockquote>
      “Contemplation is the highest expression of our intellectual and spiritual life.”<br>
      -- Thomas Merton
    </blockquote>
    <p>Whether you’re navigating transitions, honoring personal growth, or seeking wisdom in quiet moments, this gathering invites you to hold up mirrors to your experiences. Through curated conversational cards and group dialogue, we’ll explore how reflection transforms memories into meaning, challenges into resilience, and endings into new beginnings.</p>
    <p>Come with an open heart, share in soulful discussions, and leave with fresh insights, and the art of integrating life’s lessons.</p>

    <h3>Inviting all Curious Souls passionate about:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>🌙 Embracing stillness and introspection.</li>
      <li>🌱 Honoring growth through life’s seasons.</li>
      <li>💬 Deepening self-awareness collectively.</li>
      <li>🕯️ Finding light in moments of transition.</li>
      <li>📖 Weaving personal stories into shared wisdom.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>🗓️ Agenda / What You'll Experience</h2>

    <h3>💬 Icebreaker Conversation Cards (Round 1)</h3>
    <p>Begin with reflection-themed virtual question cards to spark intimate exchanges. Here are some sample questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Reflection on Endings and Transitions</strong><br>
        <em>“How does reflecting on endings change how we meet beginnings?”<br>
        “How has a parting or ending clarified what truly matters to you?”<br>
        “How do we honor what’s leaving without grasping?”</em>
      </li>
      <li><strong>2. Introspection and Self-Discovery</strong><br>
        <em>“Where did you find strength by looking back?”<br>
        “What does your ‘past self’ wish you remembered today?”<br>
        “Where do you feel ‘home’ inside yourself?”</em>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: The first round may involve virtual question cards accessed via a link or QR code. If you do not have a device (phone/tablet) to access these, please ask a facilitator for assistance; we have spare units available.</p>

    <h3>💬 Spontaneous Reflection Question (Optional Round 2)</h3>
    <p>Unless we choose to extend Round One, after warming up, our diverse group of friends and strangers will come together in a circle to exchange ideas on an intriguing topic chosen spontaneously.</p>
    <p>Each participant is encouraged to contribute by sharing a unique question. You’re welcome to bring a question that’s been on your mind, or you can draw inspiration from the icebreaker conversation cards provided. Once all the questions are collected, the group will collaboratively select one to kick off the discussion.</p>
    <p>From there, we’ll embark on a respectful, engaging, and meaningful conversation, celebrating the diversity of perspectives and ideas within the group.</p>

    <h3>💬 Final Thoughts and Feedback</h3>
    <p>Where time allows, in the final 10 minutes of the event, we’ll take a moment to reflect on the key insights, memorable moments, and takeaways from our discussions. This is a chance to distill the shared wisdom and leave with a deeper understanding of the topics we’ve explored together.</p>
    <p>After the event officially concludes, the group may choose to extend the session, depending on the group’s interest. Of course, you’re welcome to leave at any time that feels right for you.</p>
