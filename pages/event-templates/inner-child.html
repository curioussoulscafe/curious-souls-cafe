    <p>A journey to the next stage of growth: where innocence meets wisdom, and play fuels transformation.</p>
    <blockquote>
      "The child is innocence and forgetting, a new beginning, a game, a self-propelled wheel."
      <br>-- Nietzsche, Thus Spoke Zarathustra
    </blockquote>
    <p>Amid adult responsibilities, we often lose touch with the curiosity, creativity, and courage that flowed naturally in childhood. This gathering invites you to gently reconnect with your inner child -- not to dwell in the past, but to reclaim those qualities as tools for present growth and authentic living.</p>
    <p>Come explore how childlike wonder can coexist with adult wisdom. Share stories, play, and leave with practices to nurture your wholeness.</p>

    <h3>Inviting all who...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>🎨 Feel a tug toward creativity/play they’ve neglected.</li>
      <li>🛡️ Seek resilience through self-compassion (not perfection).</li>
      <li>🌀 Sense that "adulting" has muted their spontaneity.</li>
      <li>🌱 Believe wisdom includes lightness, not just seriousness.</li>
      <li>✨ Want to transform old wounds into freedom.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🗓️ Agenda / What You'll Experience</h2>

    <h3>💬 Icebreaker: Doorways to Wonder (Round One)</h3>
    <p>We’ll use light-hearted conversation cards made by WNRS to facilitate a gentle journey into our inner child. Through playful prompts and reflective questions, we’ll explore childhood memories, honor unmet needs, and reconnect with forgotten parts of ourselves.</p>

    <h3>💬 In-Depth Exploration: Rekindling Your Inner Child (Round Two)</h3>
    <p>Continue with themed virtual question cards to spark intimate exchanges. Here are some sample questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Playful Rediscovery</strong><br>
        <em>“What’s one simple, childlike joy you’ve reclaimed recently? (e.g., doodling, cloud-watching, dancing badly)”<br>
        “Describe a toy, book, or place that made you feel safe as a child. How could its essence comfort you now?”</em>
      </li>
      <li><strong>2. Wisdom of "the Child"</strong><br>
        <em>“Nietzsche called the child ‘a new beginning.’ Where in your life are you craving rebirth over repetition?”<br>
        “How could approaching a current challenge with playful curiosity shift it?”</em>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: This session may involve virtual question cards accessed via a link or QR code. If you do not have a device (phone/tablet) to access these, please ask a facilitator for assistance; we have spare units available.</p>

    <h3>💬 Spontaneous Reflection Question (Optional)</h3>
    <p>After warming up, our diverse group of friends and strangers will come together to exchange ideas on an intriguing topic chosen spontaneously.</p>
    <p>Each participant is encouraged to contribute by sharing a unique question. You’re welcome to bring a question that’s been on your mind, or you can draw inspiration from the icebreaker conversation cards provided. Once all the questions are collected, the group will collaboratively select one to kick off the discussion.</p>
    <p>From there, we’ll embark on a respectful, engaging, and meaningful conversation, celebrating the diversity of perspectives and ideas within the group.</p>

    <h3>💬 Final Thoughts and Feedback</h3>
    <p>Where time allows, in the final 10 minutes of the event, we’ll take a moment to reflect on the key insights, memorable moments, and takeaways from our discussions. This is a chance to distill the shared wisdom and leave with a deeper understanding of the topics we’ve explored together.</p>
    <p>After the event officially concludes, the group may choose to extend the session, depending on the group’s interest. Of course, you’re welcome to leave at any time that feels right for you.</p>
