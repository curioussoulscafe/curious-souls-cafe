    <p>With a total of 30 specially curated questions, we will flip 4 cards from the deck. Each participant gets to answer any one of the 4 questions. After everyone has had their turn, another set of 4 cards will be shown from the deck. This will repeat until the cards run out.</p>

    <h3>💬 Round 2: Ask Your Own Questions</h3>
    <p>Each participant can write down their own question and ask others for their input. You can also select any question from the previous deck.</p>

    <h3>💬 Final Thoughts and Feedback</h3>
