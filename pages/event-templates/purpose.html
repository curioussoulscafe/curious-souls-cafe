    <h2>Purpose: The Compass of a Meaningful Life</h2>
    <p>A reflective exploration of what it means to live with purpose‚Äînot as a single destination to be found, but as a direction to be chosen, built, and rediscovered throughout our lives.</p>
    <blockquote>
      "The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well."
      <br>‚Äî Adapted from Ralph Waldo Emerson
    </blockquote>
    <p>In a world of endless choices and noise, finding our unique signal can feel daunting. This gathering is for those asking the quiet, essential questions: What is my work here? What matters most? How do I align my daily life with what feels truly meaningful? We will explore purpose not as a fixed title, but as an evolving practice of listening, contributing, and courageously showing up.</p>
    <p>Come with curiosity, share from the heart, and leave with a clearer sense of your own direction.</p>

    <h3>üëã Inviting all who are:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>üß≠ Feeling a pull toward something more meaningful.</li>
      <li>üîç Questioning the "why" behind their daily routines.</li>
      <li>üí´ Sensing a purpose that is emerging or changing.</li>
      <li>üå± Wanting to contribute to something larger than themselves.</li>
      <li>‚ú® Ready to listen to their own inner compass.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üìÖ Agenda / What You'll Experience</h2>

    <h3>üí¨ Icebreaker Conversation Cards (Round 1)</h3>
    <p>Begin with themed questions to spark intimate and reflective exchanges.</p>
    <h4>1. Personal Reflection:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>"What‚Äôs one activity or task that makes you lose track of time? What might that reveal about what you find meaningful?"</li>
      <li>"What‚Äôs a problem in the world that breaks your heart or makes you angry? How might that point you toward a purpose?"</li>
      <li>"What is a piece of wisdom about 'a life well-lived' that you inherited from your family or culture? Does it still resonate?"</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>2. Growth & Evolution:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>"How has your sense of purpose changed over the last five years? What experiences catalyzed that change?"</li>
      <li>"Where do you feel the tension between practical responsibilities and your deeper sense of purpose?"</li>
      <li>"What‚Äôs one small, purposeful action you took recently that felt deeply right?"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: This session may involve virtual question cards accessed via a link or QR code. If you do not have a device (phone/tablet) to access these, please ask a facilitator for assistance; we have spare units available.</p>

    <h3>üí¨ Spontaneous Reflective Question (Optional Round 2)</h3>
    <p>After warming up, our group will exchange ideas on an intriguing topic chosen spontaneously. We may continue with questions from Round 1 or write new ones. Each participant is encouraged to contribute by sharing a unique question or drawing inspiration from the conversation cards.</p>

    <h3>üí¨ Final Thoughts and Feedback</h3>
    <p>In the final 10 minutes, we‚Äôll reflect on the key insights, memorable moments, and takeaways from our discussions. This is a chance to distill shared wisdom and leave with a deeper understanding of the topic.</p>
    <p>After the event officially concludes, we may extend the session for informal conversations, depending on the group‚Äôs interest. You‚Äôre welcome to leave at any time that feels right for you.</p>
