    <h2>Entrepreneurship: Architecting Your Life Venture</h2>
    <p>What if entrepreneurship isn’t just about startups--but about becoming the architect of your own existence? This gathering explores entrepreneurship as a mindset for intentional living: prototyping paths, embracing uncertainty, and investing your "life capital" wisely.</p>
    <blockquote>
      "A life venture isn’t launched -- it’s prototyped through courageous experiments."
      <br>-- Inspired by Eric Ries and The School of Life
    </blockquote>
    <p>Whether you’re building a business, career, or meaningful life -- discover how entrepreneurial thinking fosters ownership, adaptability, and purposeful action in times of change.</p>
    
    <hr>

    <h2>Inviting All Who...</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>💡 Feel called to take creative ownership of their path</li>
      <li>⚖️ Balance practicality with visionary thinking</li>
      <li>🛠️ Want to invest their "life resources" more intentionally</li>
      <li>🔄 See "failure" as data for their next iteration</li>
      <li>🌱 Crave meaningful exchange over business jargon (or entrepreneurship beyond startups)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We’ll blend discussion with tactile, low-pressure activities -- no business experience required, just curiosity about designing your one wild life.</p>

    <h3>Who Might Enjoy This:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>🔹 People who believe rest can be radical R&D</li>
      <li>🔹 Creatives who hate the word "hustle"</li>
      <li>🔹 Overthinkers ready to experiment</li>
      <li>🔹 Anyone who’s ever felt like a "startup" navigating adulthood</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Come reimagine your life as your most vital venture.</p>

    <h2>📅 Agenda / What You'll Experience</h2>

    <h3>💬 Icebreaker Reflective Cards (Round 1)</h3>
    <p>We’ll ground ourselves using specially crafted virtual reflective question cards. Here’s an example of a reflective prompt we might begin with:</p>
    <blockquote>
      “When have you acted as an 'entrepreneur of your life'--making a bold choice others didn’t understand? What did it teach you about self-leadership?”
    </blockquote>
    <p>Note: This session may involve virtual question cards accessed via a link or QR code. If you do not have a device (phone/tablet) to access these, please ask a facilitator for assistance; we have spare units available.</p>

    <h3>💬 Spontaneous Reflective Question (Optional Round 2)</h3>
    <p>After warming up, our diverse group of friends and strangers will come together in a circle to exchange ideas on an intriguing topic chosen spontaneously. We may either continue with questions from round one, or write our own questions.</p>
    <p>Each participant is encouraged to contribute by sharing a unique question. You’re welcome to bring a question that’s been on your mind, or you can draw inspiration from the conversation cards provided. Once all the questions are collected, the group will collaboratively select one to kick off the discussion.</p>
    <p>From there, we’ll embark on a respectful, engaging, and meaningful conversation, celebrating the diversity of perspectives and ideas within the group.</p>

    <h3>💬 Final Thoughts and Feedback</h3>
    <p>Where time allows, in the final 10 minutes of the event, we’ll take a moment to reflect on the key insights, memorable moments, and takeaways from our discussions. This is a chance to distill the shared wisdom and leave with a deeper understanding of the topics we’ve explored together.</p>
    <p>After the event officially concludes, the group may choose to extend the session, depending on the group’s interest. Of course, you’re welcome to leave at any time that feels right for you.</p>
