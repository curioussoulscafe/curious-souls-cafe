    <h2>Interdependence: The Art of Needing and Being Needed</h2>
    <p>A reflective exploration of how we build reciprocal bonds that honor both autonomy and connection.</p>
    <blockquote>
      "We are islands, but beneath the surface, we are continents."
      <br>-- Adapted from John Donne
    </blockquote>
    <p>As life’s scripts transform, we’re called to reimagine connection. This gathering is for those navigating the delicate dance between independence and togetherness, especially when old models of "self-reliance" or "codependency" no longer serve.</p>
    <p>Come explore how our lives are woven together, share from the heart, and leave with fresh ways to nurture collective resilience.</p>

    <h3>Inviting all who are...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>🌿 Curious about navigating autonomy within connection.</li>
      <li>✨ Understanding when solitude fuels connection vs. isolates.</li>
      <li>💭 Reflecting on reciprocity in relationships.</li>
      <li>🌀 Sensing that their solitude is part of a larger ecology.</li>
      <li>🗺️ Seeking maps for belonging in a fragmented world.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🗓️ Agenda / What You'll Experience</h2>

    <h3>💬 Icebreaker Conversation Cards (Round 1)</h3>
    <p>Begin with themed virtual question cards to spark intimate exchanges. Here are some sample questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Personal Reflection on Interdependence</strong><br>
        <em>“How has your cultural background (e.g., filial piety / Western individualism) shaped your relationship with needing others?”<br>
        “When did you last feel deeply supported? How did it shift your understanding of giving/receiving?”<br>
        “Where do you feel tension between 'I should handle this alone' and 'I need support'? What’s one micro-step toward asking?”<br>
        “How has relying on others strengthened rather than diminished you?”</em>
      </li>
      <li><strong>2. Connection with the Interconnected World / Interbeing</strong><br>
        <em>“What ‘invisible exchange’ nourishes you daily? (e.g., the oak tree gifting oxygen to your breath)”<br>
        “Describe an ‘unboundaried’ relationship you have with the more-than-human world.”</em>
      </li>
      <li><strong>3. Community & Relational Dynamics</strong><br>
        <em>“What 'invisible threads' (e.g., neighbors, strangers) sustain your daily life?”<br>
        “Where do you sense an invitation to deepen interdependence in your relationships or community?”<br>
        “What practices help you honor both individuality and togetherness?”<br>
        “How does your solitude serve the collective?”</em>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>From there, we’ll embark on a respectful, engaging, and meaningful conversation, celebrating the diversity of perspectives and ideas within the group.</p>
    <p>Note: This session may involve virtual question cards accessed via a link or QR code. If you do not have a device (phone/tablet) to access these, please ask a facilitator for assistance; we have spare units available.</p>

    <h3>💬 Spontaneous Reflection Question (Optional Round 2)</h3>
    <p>Unless we choose to extend Round One, after warming up, our diverse group of friends and strangers will come together in a circle to exchange ideas on an intriguing topic chosen spontaneously.</p>
    <p>Each participant is encouraged to contribute by sharing a unique question. You’re welcome to bring a question that’s been on your mind, or you can draw inspiration from the icebreaker conversation cards provided. Once all the questions are collected, the group will collaboratively select one to kick off the discussion.</p>

    <h3>💬 Final Thoughts and Feedback</h3>
    <p>Where time allows, in the final 10 minutes of the event, we’ll take a moment to reflect on the key insights, memorable moments, and takeaways from our discussions. This is a chance to distill the shared wisdom and leave with a deeper understanding of the topics we’ve explored together.</p>
