    <p>A reflective exploration of how connections shape our lives, sustain us through change, and help us grow into more compassionate selves.</p>
    <blockquote>
      "Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ‘What! You too? I thought I was the only one.’"
      <br>-- Adapted from C.S. Lewis
    </blockquote>
    <p>As life unfolds, our relationships gently evolve. Some bonds deepen; others transform or fade. This gathering is for those curious about the art of friendship--how we nurture connections, honor their seasons, and rediscover meaning through the people who walk beside us.</p>
    <p>Come with openness, share from the heart, and leave with fresh appreciation for the ties that shape your journey.</p>

    <h3>Inviting all who are...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>🌿 Noticing how friendships shift across life’s seasons.</li>
      <li>💭 Reflecting on what makes a connection meaningful.</li>
      <li>✨ Longing to deepen existing bonds or cultivate new ones.</li>
      <li>🗺️ Navigating changes in relationships with grace.</li>
      <li>🌅 Honoring past connections while embracing new ones.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🗓️ Agenda / What You'll Experience</h2>

    <h3>💬 Icebreaker: Doorways to Connection (Round One)</h3>
    <p>We’ll use thoughtful conversation prompts from past sessions or those inspired by WNRS to gently step into the heart of friendship. Through playful and reflective questions, we’ll explore moments that shaped our connections, honor the bonds that nourish us, and rediscover the joy of meaningful relationships.</p>

    <h3>💬 In-Depth Exploration: Deepening the Bonds of Friendship (Round Two)</h3>
    <p>Continue with themed virtual question cards to spark intimate exchanges. Here are some sample questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Personal Reflections</strong><br>
        <em>“What’s one small moment that deepened a friendship unexpectedly?”<br>
        “How has a friend helped you see yourself or the world differently?”<br>
        “What qualities do you cherish most in a friendship today vs. 10 years ago?”</em>
      </li>
      <li><strong>2. Growth & Connection</strong><br>
        <em>“Where do you feel an invitation to nurture or reimagine a friendship?”<br>
        “How do friendships sustain us through life’s transitions?”<br>
        “When have you navigated a friendship ending or changing--and what did it teach you?”</em>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: This session may involve virtual question cards accessed via a link or QR code. If you do not have a device (phone/tablet) to access these, please ask a facilitator for assistance; we have spare units available.</p>

    <h3>💬 Spontaneous Reflection Question (Optional)</h3>
    <p>After warming up, our diverse group of friends and strangers will come together to exchange ideas on an intriguing topic chosen spontaneously.</p>
    <p>Each participant is encouraged to contribute by sharing a unique question. You’re welcome to bring a question that’s been on your mind, or you can draw inspiration from the icebreaker conversation cards provided. Once all the questions are collected, the group will collaboratively select one to kick off the discussion.</p>
    <p>From there, we’ll embark on a respectful, engaging, and meaningful conversation, celebrating the diversity of perspectives and ideas within the group.</p>

    <h3>💬 Final Thoughts and Feedback</h3>
    <p>Where time allows, in the final 10 minutes of the event, we’ll take a moment to reflect on the key insights, memorable moments, and takeaways from our discussions. This is a chance to distill the shared wisdom and leave with a deeper understanding of the topics we’ve explored together.</p>
    <p>After the event officially concludes, the group may choose to extend the session, depending on the group’s interest. Of course, you’re welcome to leave at any time that feels right for you.</p>
