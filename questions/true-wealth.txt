ðŸŒ± What is one non-material thing that made you feel truly 'rich' recently?
ðŸŒ€ Describe a moment where you felt a deep sense of 'enough.'
What does your â€˜rich lifeâ€™ look like, feel like, and sound like? Describe it in vivid detail.
What is a â€˜wealthâ€™ you possess that you couldnâ€™t put a price on? (e.g., a skill, a relationship, a perspective)
ðŸŒ€ Where do you currently experience the most scarcity in your life? (e.g., time, quiet, connection) And where do you experience the most abundance?
How can we cultivate â€˜wealthâ€™ in areas of scarcity?
ðŸŒ± What is one small, daily ritual that makes you feel richer?
ðŸŒ€ How does the concept of â€˜true wealthâ€™ change how you think about your work and time?
In a world that often praises conventional success, many people sense a quiet longing for something more. What areas in your life, if any, feel out of alignment with your deepest values or aspirations, and what do you believe might be contributing to this feeling?
Our society often highlights a particular definition of a 'successful' or 'rich' life. What does this commonly celebrated definition entail, and how might it differ from what truly enriches and nourishes your life?
Imagine a life where you could freely pursue a 'private business' â€“ a passion, a creative endeavor, or a deeper personal quest â€“ with minimal distractions. What would that 'private business' be for you, and what are the primary obstacles you feel prevent you from dedicating more time to it?
ðŸŒ± It's often suggested that the most profound needs of our spirit or soul don't require money. Can you share a memory where you experienced deep satisfaction, connection, or meaning that was completely unrelated to financial cost? What made that moment truly valuable?
ðŸŒ± Much of our life can feel 'frittered away by details.' What aspects of your daily routine or commitments feel most burdensome, and if you could simplify just one thing, how might that create more space for 'life's finer fruits' or a deeper sense of presence?
Many things we consider 'luxuries' or 'comforts' can sometimes become hindrances. Is there a particular possession, habit, or 'comfort' in your life that, upon reflection, might actually be preventing you from experiencing a deeper sense of freedom, purpose, or connection?
ðŸŒ€ Rather than constantly striving to acquire more, true abundance might sometimes be found in purposefully 'doing without'. What aspects of a truly rich and fulfilling life, for you, involve reducing your material needs or simplifying your consumption, rather than accumulating possessions?
ðŸŒ€ The idea of being truly 'awake' to life, beyond mere physical consciousness, is powerful. How do you consciously engage with each day to 'awaken' your senses, mind, or spirit, and cultivate a deeper, more 'poetic' or meaningful experience of being alive?
What if the effort required to 'make a living' could be minimized, allowing for more time dedicated to personal passions and a richer experience of life? How might reimagining your current relationship with work and 'making a living' free up more time for your chosen pursuits and a richer experience of life?
ðŸŒ€ Our daily lives are often shaped by a feeling of "not enough"â€”not enough time, rest, or even personal worth. What messages about "not enough" have you absorbed from society, and how might they be influencing your pursuit of a rich life, beyond just financial abundance?
Consider the idea that sufficiency can be understood as an inner knowing that "there is enough, and that we are enough." Can you recall a specific time in your life when you deeply felt this sense of "enough," irrespective of your external circumstances, and what did that experience teach you about true wealth?
Imagine your resourcesâ€”such as time, attention, or financial capitalâ€”as being like water, flowing through your life like water, capable of nourishing or becoming stagnant. How do you currently direct these flows to reflect your deepest values and commitments, ensuring they nourish what truly matters to you?
ðŸŒ± There's a principle that "what you appreciate appreciates"â€”meaning, our conscious attention can increase the perceived value of what we already have. What non-financial aspects of your life (e.g., relationships, nature, personal qualities) are you actively appreciating, and how does this practice enhance your sense of true wealth and well-being?
ðŸŒ± Many cultures and communities demonstrate that true prosperity can arise from collaboration and sharing diverse resources. Can you share an an experience where working with others, pooling different strengths and contributions (not just money), led to unexpected abundance or a deeper sense of connection for everyone involved?
ðŸŒ€ Many feel a tension between "making a living" and "designing a life" that aligns with their deepest values. Where do you currently feel this tension most acutely, and what small, intentional shift could help bridge that gap in your daily life?
ðŸŒ€ Some wisdom traditions suggest we need to "change the dream" from a "dream of more" (e.g., more possessions, more money) to one of sufficiency and reverence for life. What does "changing the dream" mean for your personal definition of a "rich life," and how might that influence your daily choices regarding time, connection, and well-being?
ðŸŒ€ Reflecting on the idea of a "legacy of enough"â€”a life lived and resources used in a way that celebrates sufficiency. What kind of "legacy of enough" are you cultivating, not just financially, but in how you invest your time, attention, and love in your relationships and community?
We live in a consumer culture that constantly encourages spending and acquiring. How do you navigate these messages to ensure your choices about what you buy (or don't buy) align with your deepest values and your vision for a sustainable, meaningful life?
The conversations we engage in, both internally and externally, significantly shape our experience of the world. How can we intentionally shift our everyday conversationsâ€”about money, time, and well-beingâ€”from a focus on fear or lack to one of gratitude, possibility, and what is already enough?
ðŸŒ± The idea that "true wealth is the ability to fully experience life" suggests a focus beyond just financial capital. When you reflect on your life, what personal experiencesâ€”big or small, costly or freeâ€”do you consider to be your most valuable forms of wealth right now, and why do they resonate so deeply with you?
Many of us navigate life on "autopilot," making choices out of habit or societal expectation rather than deliberate intention. What is one routine or habit in your daily life where you feel you might be operating on "autopilot" regarding your time, energy, or connection? What mindful shift could you make to align it more closely with your deepest values and your vision of a truly rich life?
ðŸŒ± Unlike material possessions, experiences have a unique power to grow in value over time as we recall and relive them, paying what some call a "memory dividend". Think of an experience from your pastâ€”perhaps a challenging adventure, a moment of profound connection, or a simple joy. How does remembering this experience continue to bring you joy, wisdom, or insight, making it an enduring source of personal wealth?
Life reminds us that "timing matters" for experiences, as our health and physical abilities can decline with age, affecting what we can truly enjoy. Considering your current balance of health, free time, and personal resources, what significant experience or pursuit are you considering prioritizing in your life now, rather than postponing it for a "someday" that might never come?
ðŸŒ€ Sometimes, the greatest risk isn't taking action, but inaction, leading to regret and a sense of "what if?". What "bold" (not foolish) move or change, perhaps related to your personal growth, career path, or relationships, have you been contemplating? What unlived experiences or missed opportunities might you face if you don't pursue it?
ðŸŒ€ Beyond financial inheritance, many believe that our most meaningful contributions (our "real legacy") to loved ones and our community are the shared experiences and memories we create with them. What kind of non-financial legacy, rich in shared experiences and connection, do you aspire to build or enhance with your family or community in the years to come? How might giving support or resources to others earlier in their lives create a greater positive impact than waiting?
Many people associate wealth with a high income and visible possessions, such as a fancy car. However, others define true wealth as the income not spent or hidden financial assetsâ€”like the car not purchasedâ€”that provide options and flexibility. How does distinguishing between visible "richness" and unseen "wealth" change your perspective on living an abundant life?
ðŸŒ€ It's observed that people often desire expensive items hoping they will signal success and earn respect. Yet, others typically admire the item itself, not the owner. How does this paradox of seeking admiration through possessions resonate with your experiences, and what genuine ways do you believe cultivate respect and connection?
A profound definition of wealth suggests it's the ability to wake up every morning and say, 'I can do whatever I want today'. How has having, or lacking, control over your time affected your happiness and well-being, and what small steps could you take to increase this control in your daily life?
ðŸŒ€ A famous anecdote tells of a writer who, when compared to a billionaire, simply stated he had "enough." In a world constantly pushing for more, how do you personally define and cultivate a sense of "enough" or sufficiency in your life? What helps you resist the urge for the goalpost of ambition to keep moving?
When making significant life and financial choices, it's sometimes argued that being "pretty reasonable" â€“ prioritizing what helps you "sleep well at night" â€“ can be more effective than being coldly rational. How does this idea of emotional comfort and long-term adherence, even if not perfectly logical, align with your deepest values and life decisions?
Life outcomes are often influenced by forces beyond individual effort, like luck and risk. It's said that because of this, things are "never as good or as bad as it seems". How does acknowledging the role of luck and risk influence your understanding of personal success and setbacks, and how you view the wealth of others?
Beyond specific spending goals, saving money can provide invaluable "options and flexibility," giving you "the ability to wait and the opportunity to pounce". This unseen benefit offers control over your time and helps manage life's surprises. How do you see this intangible value of financial flexibility contributing to a life rich in time, connection, and meaning?
ðŸŒ€ It's a common human tendency to underestimate how much our personalities, desires, and goals will change over time. When striving for "true wealth," how do you plan for your evolving future self to avoid making extreme long-term decisions that you might later regret?
ðŸŒ€ Achieving anything truly worthwhile, including a life rich in time, connection, and meaning, often comes with "invisible price tags" such as volatility, fear, doubt, and regret. How have you experienced these non-monetary costs in your pursuit of a well-lived life, and what does it mean to be willing to "pay the price" for what genuinely nourishes you?
ðŸŒ€ In life, we are often influenced by the actions of others who may be pursuing different goals or playing a different "game". How important is it to identify your own "game" in terms of time, connection, and meaning, and how do you ensure your choices are aligned with your personal values rather than external pressures?
Progress often happens so slowly that we hardly notice it, while setbacks and losses can be sudden and dramatic. How does this human tendency to overlook gradual improvement, but magnify immediate challenges, impact your perspective on cultivating long-term well-being and "true wealth"?
ðŸŒ± Money can be a magnifying glass that helps explain human behavior, revealing the diverse lessons people learn based on their unique experiences. How do your own personal experiences with money shape your understanding of "true wealth," and how might they differ from those around you?
ðŸŒ€ The Psychology of Money points out that most huge, profitable, or influential outcomes in business, investing, and even life, are the result of "tail events" â€“ a small minority of efforts accounting for the majority of results. This means it's normal for many things to go wrong. How does this understanding impact your willingness to try new things or persevere when initial efforts don't yield immediate success in building a rich life?
Despite advances in wealth, many people don't feel happier because they've used increased wealth to buy more things but simultaneously diminished their control over time. What choices could you make to prioritize regaining or maintaining control over your time as a core component of your true wealth?
The School of Life suggests that determining "how much money do I need?" requires defining "what are my real objectives?" and "what does money contribute?" to those objectives. What does "enough" truly look like for you in terms of time, connection, well-being, and financial resources, and what practices help you cultivate this sense of sufficiency in your daily life?
The School of Life draws a distinction between what they call "higher needs"â€”such as deep friendships, a sense of mission in life, or emotional maturityâ€”and "middle needs" like status, fashionable clothes, or exotic travel. How do you intentionally prioritize and invest your time, energy, and resources to cultivate these "higher needs" in your life, especially when they might not directly align with conventional markers of success or "middle needs"?
The School of Life defines "flourishing" as "making a difference, pursuing the things you care about, developing your talents and fostering the talents of others". What "difference" do you most aspire to make in the world, or what "talents" do you feel called to develop or foster in others, and how does your understanding of "true wealth" enable or align with these deeper aspirations?
The School of Life describes money as an "ingredient" or a "means of exchange" for achieving a good life, rather than an end in itself. Considering this perspective, what non-financial "ingredients" â€“ such as time, attention, well-being, or connection â€“ do you believe are most crucial for you to cultivate a truly flourishing life?
ðŸŒ€ The School of Life explores the challenge of simultaneously "making enough money (to meet our real needs) and doing things that help to make sense of who we are and meet our deep longing for meaning and to contribute to the collective good". How do you actively seek to bridge this gap, integrating your efforts to earn money with your deepest values and aspirations for a meaningful life?
ðŸŒ€ The School of Life suggests distinguishing between a "need" and a "want" by asking: "how central is it to my becoming a good version of myself; what is it actually for in my life?". How do you personally differentiate between a genuine "need" that supports your flourishing, and a "want" that might be more influenced by external pressures, comparisons, or fleeting desires?
ðŸŒ€ The School of Life highlights that "money worries are about what is going on in your head, not just what is going on in your bank account". Thinking beyond financial facts, what deep-seated emotions, values, or perhaps even unexamined beliefs might shape your personal relationship with money and influence your vision of a truly rich life?
ðŸŒ± Sometimes, our appreciation for things decreases simply because their market price falls, even if their inherent beauty or utility hasn't changed. For example, historically, highly prized pineapples became "less glamorous" when they became widely available and inexpensive, and the awe-inspiring view from an airplane became "commonplace" after cheap flights became accessible. Can you think of something inexpensive or commonly available in your life that brings you profound joy or a deep sense of value, regardless of its low monetary cost?
ðŸŒ± Children, before they learn about "expensive" and "cheap," often find wonder and delight in very simple, everyday things, appreciating their "intrinsic merits" regardless of cost. Similarly, artists, like Paul CÃ©zanne, can find a "veritable universe of distinctive colour and aura" in a common apple, helping us appreciate what we "already have to hand". What seemingly ordinary or overlooked objects, experiences, or moments in your daily life could you begin to see with this kind of fresh wonder or deeper appreciation? How might this shift in perspective contribute to your sense of a "richer" life?
Society often links a person's income to their worth or the respect they receive. However, The School of Life suggests that wages are often determined more by supply and demand for a particular job than by its actual social contribution or inherent value. For example, a hospice nurse, doing incredibly meaningful work, might earn a fraction of someone in a role with less social benefit but higher demand. Beyond financial earnings or conventional success, what qualities, contributions, or acts of service do you believe truly enrich a community or individual's life? How can we collectively give "proper appreciation" to people whose true merit might be overlooked by a focus on income?
The School of Life suggests we are often "bad at shopping" for ourselves because our desires are heavily influenced by "group instincts" and "societal norms," rather than our "native inclinations". It implies we need to become "doggedly precise" in identifying what genuinely brings us pleasure and fulfillment, rather than what society dictates. Thinking about past choices related to your time, possessions, or experiences, have you ever felt that you pursued something because you felt you "should" want it, rather than because it truly aligned with your deepest desires? What steps can you take to more authentically identify and pursue what genuinely enriches your life, rather than following external scripts?
ðŸŒ€ We often view materialism as inherently negative, focusing on mere acquisition. However, The School of Life introduces a concept of "good materialism," where certain objects can "transubstantiate," meaning they embody or allude to higher, positive ideals or qualities (e.g., a simple, sturdy wooden chair might embody honesty or strength). By engaging with such objects, we might connect with our "better selves". Can you identify a material possession you own that represents or evokes a deeply valued quality or ideal for you (e.g., simplicity, creativity, connection, comfort, mindfulness)? How does this object, through its symbolic or intrinsic qualities, contribute to your personal sense of "true wealth" and help you connect with your "better nature"?
ðŸŒ± Many believe that genuine enjoyment in life isn't solely linked to how much money is spent, but rather to other "key ingredients" like friends, conversation, freedom, curiosity, and love. Which of these "ingredients" do you feel most abundant in within your life, and which do you long to cultivate more of to enhance your sense of true wealth?
