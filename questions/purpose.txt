How can confronting this fundamental question, rather than avoiding it, become a starting point for defining your own purpose?

ðŸŒ€ Albert Camus says embracing the absurd leads to three attitudes: revolt (refusing to surrender to meaninglessness), freedom (being released from hope for a better future), and passion (filling a life with as many experiences as possible). How could actively cultivating revolt, freedom, and passion help you choose a direction and live more meaningfully today?
ðŸŒ€ In Greek mythology, Sisyphus is condemned to push a boulder up a hill for eternity, only for it to roll back down each time.

What does his story teach us about finding dignity and purpose in the conscious, continuous act of "showing up" and engaging with our own struggles, regardless of the outcome?
ðŸŒ€ Albert Camus sees creation as the ultimate absurd joyâ€”a revolt against meaninglessness where the act itself is the purpose. How might we reframe our own work and contributions to find meaning in the creative process itself, even without the promise of lasting impact or external validation?
Emerson suggests the purpose of life is to be useful and honorable, not just happy. How do you define a "good" job that truly makes a difference, beyond its salary?
