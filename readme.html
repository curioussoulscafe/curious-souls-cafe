  <h1 id="curious-souls-caf-">Curious Souls Café</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the <a href="https://curioussoulscafe.substack.com/about">Curious Souls Café</a>! This <a href="https://curioussoulscafe.github.io/curious-souls-cafe/">live web app</a> is your companion for exploring fascinating ideas and fostering meaningful connections with others. Through thought-provoking questions, it offers conversation starters for friends, prompts for personal journaling, or fresh ideas to ponder.</p>
  <p>Originally created to facilitate meaningful discussions during Curious Souls Café <a href="https://curioussoulscafe.substack.com/p/event-structure">meetup events</a>, this app is now available to everyone, bringing the spirit of curiosity and connection to your fingertips. (Please note: the app is actively evolving, so features may be added, updated, or refined as we continue to enhance the experience.)</p>
  <h2 id="-getting-started">🚀 Getting Started</h2>
  <p>Step into meaningful conversations with ease! Here&#39;s how you can join the fun:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Launch the Live Web App</strong><br>Open the Curious Souls Café web app in your browser by clicking this link: <a href="https://curioussoulscafe.github.io/curious-souls-cafe/">Curious Souls Café Web App</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Invite Others</strong><br>On the main page, you&#39;ll find a QR code. Share it with friends or participants—anyone can scan it to instantly join the conversation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Pick a Topic</strong><br>Gather your group, choose a topic (or question deck) that resonates with everyone, and let the exploration of ideas begin!</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Start the Conversation</strong><br>Unsure where to start? Try <a href="https://curioussoulscafe.substack.com/i/154389021/style-one-open-discussion">Style One – Open Discussion</a>: With the three questions presented (by default), each person chooses their favorite one, and then rolls a <a href="https://curioussoulscafe.github.io/curious-souls-cafe/pages/dice-roll.html">colorful dice</a> to determine whose question goes first (e.g., the person whose virtual question card matches the dice color). After the first person has finished sharing, they pick a direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) for the discussion to proceed.</p>
      <p>Participants take turns answering the chosen question, with the option to pass if they feel uncomfortable. This style fosters a relaxed and organic way to engage with the group while ensuring everyone has the opportunity to participate. If the group size is large, consider forming smaller breakout groups for a more intimate and manageable discussion.</p>
      <p>For a more personal approach, explore <a href="https://curioussoulscafe.substack.com/i/154389021/style-two-paired-discussion">Style Two – Paired Discussion</a>, which encourages deeper one-on-one conversations before regrouping for collective sharing.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
<p>Enjoy diving into thought-provoking topics, building connections, and sharing perspectives with fellow curious minds! 😊</p>

<p>Let these decks inspire your journey of exploration, connection, and growth!</p>
<h2 id="-what-you-can-do-with-the-web-app">✨ What You Can Do with the Web App</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pick a Topic:</strong> On the <a href="https://curioussoulscafe.github.io/curious-souls-cafe/">main page</a>, you&#39;ll see general questions like <a href="https://curioussoulscafe.github.io/curious-souls-cafe/pages/icebreaker.html">Icebreaker</a> and different topics like <a href="https://curioussoulscafe.github.io/curious-souls-cafe/pages/transitions.html">Transitions</a> or <a href="https://curioussoulscafe.github.io/curious-souls-cafe/pages/love-relationships.html">Love Relationships</a>. Just click (or tap) on a topic button to dive in!</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Get Random Questions:</strong> Once you&#39;re on a topic page, tell the web app how many questions you&#39;d like, and it will instantly give you new ones to ponder.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Find Specific Questions:</strong> Looking for something particular? Use the search bar to find questions that match your keywords.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Save Questions:</strong> See a question you like? Simply click or tap on it, and it will be added to your &quot;Saved Questions&quot; list at the bottom of the page. You can clear them anytime.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Optimized for On-the-Go:</strong> The web app is designed to work seamlessly on smartphones and tablets, making it the ideal companion for dynamic, on-the-go interactions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Join a Live Discussion</strong>: During special events, a prominent &quot;Live Discussion&quot; button will appear on the main page, giving you access to real-time questions curated for that event.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-a-fun-little-secret-">🎲 A Fun Little Secret!</h2>
<p>Did you know there&#39;s a little Easter egg in the Curious Souls Café web app? The colors of the virtual question cards (when you highlight a question or a saved one by a click/tap) aren&#39;t just random! They&#39;re designed to subtly match the fun <a href="https://curioussoulscafe.substack.com/i/154389021/the-dice-decides">dice</a> colors used by our event facilitators to make those in-person discussions even more engaging. It&#39;s a small nod to bring a bit of that real-world fun into your digital experience!</p>
<h2 id="-tips-for-using-the-app">💡 Tips for Using the App</h2>
<p>Here are some helpful tips to enhance your Curious Souls Café experience:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Highlight Chosen Questions:</strong> Always <strong>highlight the question that is chosen</strong> by tapping or clicking it. This makes it easier for other participants to focus on the active question, preventing confusion when multiple questions are displayed on the app at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Return to Main Page:</strong> Clicking the round <strong>Curious Souls Café icon</strong> at the top of any topic page will take you back to the main topic selection page. This has the same effect as clicking the &quot;Leave Page&quot; button at the bottom.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Quick Scroll to Top:</strong> The sticky <strong>&quot;Top&quot; button</strong> located at the bottom-right corner of any topic page can be used to quickly scroll back to the top of the screen. This is especially useful if you&#39;ve scrolled far down and need to quickly access controls or re-read the topic title.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Direct Topic Page Links</strong>: Each topic page has its own unique URL. You can directly link participants to a specific topic page by appending the appropriate HTML file name to the base URL. For example, to direct users to the &quot;Icebreaker&quot; topic, you would use: <code>&lt;URL&gt;/pages/icebreaker.html</code> like <a href="https://curioussoulscafe.github.io/curious-souls-cafe/pages/icebreaker.html">this</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Single Random Question for Punishments:</strong> For participants who land on a punishment (e.g., via specific <a href="https://curioussoulscafe.substack.com/i/154389021/the-dice-decides">dice</a> colors used by our facilitators) which requires them to randomly choose a question and answer it:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Set the <strong>&quot;No. of questions to pick&quot;</strong> field to <code>1</code> (instead of the default value, e.g., <code>3</code>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Then, have the participant tap <strong>&quot;Generate Questions!&quot;</strong> so that only one random question is displayed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Roll the Dice:</strong> On the main page, you&#39;ll find a &quot;<a href="https://curioussoulscafe.github.io/curious-souls-cafe/pages/dice-roll.html">Roll the Dice</a>&quot; button. This will take you to a special page where you can roll a virtual dice to get a random color outcome. Each color corresponds to a different <a href="https://curioussoulscafe.substack.com/i/154389021/the-dice-decides">category or action</a> in our in-person discussions, adding an element of chance and fun! It supports customization of colors and the number of sides, so that it can be used to break a tie too!</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Advanced Search &amp; Clear:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Searching with <strong>nothing inputted in the search field</strong> will display all questions in the current deck. Be mindful that this could quickly fill up the screen.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For more advanced searching, you can combine the above with your web browser&#39;s built-in &quot;Find&quot; functionality.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In case the screen becomes too crowded after a search, simply tap the sticky <strong>&quot;Top&quot; button</strong> and then click the <strong>&quot;Search&quot; button</strong> again (or &quot;Clear Search&quot;) to clear the search results and tidy up the display.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="-how-files-are-organized">📂 How Files Are Organized</h2>
<p>The Curious Souls Café web app keeps its files organized in a clear and maintainable way:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The main page (<code>index.html</code>) is located in the <strong>root folder</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All individual topic pages (like <code>icebreaker.html</code>, <code>love-relationships.html</code>, etc.) are located in the <strong><code>pages/</code> folder</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All the questions for each topic are stored in simple text files (<code>.txt</code>) inside the <strong><code>questions/</code> folder</strong>. For example, all &quot;Icebreaker&quot; questions are in <code>questions/icebreaker.txt</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Other data files, such as <code>quotes.txt</code>, are located in the <strong><code>data/</code> folder</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Image files, including <code>qr-code.png</code> and <code>csc_logo.jpg</code>, are stored in the <strong><code>images/</code> folder</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-for-event-facilitators">💪 For Event Facilitators</h2>
<h3 id="-how-to-add-new-question-sets">➡️ How to Add New Question Sets</h3>
<p>If you&#39;re an event facilitator looking to add new question sets to the main page, here&#39;s a straightforward process:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Add a new <code>questions.txt</code> file:</strong> Create a new text file inside the <code>questions/</code> folder. Name it clearly, reflecting your new topic (e.g., <code>questions/MyNewTopic.txt</code>). Populate this file with your questions, one per line.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Duplicate an existing HTML subpage:</strong> Choose an existing topic&#39;s HTML file (e.g., <code>icebreaker.html</code>) and duplicate it. Rename the duplicated file to match your new topic (e.g., <code>mynewtopic.html</code>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Open the file in a text editor and modify the page title, <code>questions.txt</code> link, displayed topic name, and main page link to reflect the new topic. (Tip: If <code>icebreaker.html</code> was copied, search for &quot;Icebreaker&quot; and replace each word accordingly.) You will also need to update <code>index.html</code> similarly.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Add to <code>index.html</code> Configuration:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Edit <code>index.html</code> file (located in the root of the project).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Find the <code>TOPIC_CONFIGS</code> array in the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> section.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add a new entry for your topic, ensuring the <code>name</code>, <code>htmlFileName</code> (pointing to your new file in <code>pages/</code>), and <code>txtUrl</code> (pointing to your <code>.txt</code> file in <code>questions/</code>) are correct. You can also set <code>cache: true</code> for faster loading after the first visit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By following the these steps, you can seamlessly integrate new question sets into the Curious Souls Café web app for your events!</p>
<h3 id="-managing-live-discussion-questions">➡️ Managing Live Discussion Questions</h3>
<p>The &quot;Live Discussion&quot; feature or button is designed for dynamic, event-specific use. Its visibility is controlled directly by the presence of a specific file in the repository, eliminating the need for code changes in <code>index.html</code>.</p>
<p>This allows event facilitators to quickly activate and deactivate the live discussion feature as needed for their events.</p>
<p>To enable and disable the &quot;Live Discussion&quot; button for an event:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>To Enable the &quot;Live Discussion&quot; Button:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Place the <code>live-discussion.txt</code> file</strong> (containing the specific event&#39;s questions) inside the <code>questions</code> folder in the GitHub repository.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Uncomment or unhide</strong> elements related to &quot;Live Discussion&quot; in <code>index.html</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Commit and push</strong> these changes to the GitHub repository. (The changes should then be automatically deployed to GitHub Pages within a minute.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The &quot;Live Discussion&quot; button will now be visible on the main page for participants. (Note: For those who already have the page loaded, they may need to refresh their mobile browser.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>To Disable the &quot;Live Discussion&quot; Button (after the event):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Remove the <code>live-discussion.txt</code> file</strong> from the <code>questions</code> folder in the GitHub repository.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Re-comment or hide</strong> elements related to &quot;Live Discussion&quot; in <code>index.html</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Commit and push</strong> these changes to the GitHub repository.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
